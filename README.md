This repo is home to multiple mods. Each mod has its own branch and should never end up merged back into master. The only commits to master should be updates to this README. 

##Mod Main branches
- FireEmblemMod_main
  - This is the main branch of the project for IT 266
  - This is an attempt to functionally recreate/reimplement the mechanics of Fire Emblem within this game engine
- RocketMod
  - This is a **very** simple mod that makes it so that the rocket launcher fires 25 rockets at a time
  - This mod is mostly a proof of concept and an template for how to set up new main branches for new mods

There may be more branches than are specified above. Any unspecified branches are sub-branches to the main mod branches and should be ignored by non-developers.
